Special API Definitions


Postal Type

The Canada Post has assigned each Postal Code a "type". Why? It helps them sort mail more quickly.
S - Standard - A "standard" ZIP Code is what most people think of when they talk about ZIP Codes - essentially a town, city, or a division of a city that has mail service.
P - PO Box Only - Rural towns, groups of towns, or even high-growth areas of cities are given a "PO Box Only" ZIP Code type.
U - Unique - Companies, organizations, and institutions that receive large quantities of mail are given a "unique" ZIP Code type.
M - Military - Military bases overseas - and often vessels and ships - are given a "military" ZIP Code type.


City Type

In many cases, a ZIP Code can have multiple "names", meaning cities, towns, or subdivisions, in its boundaries. However, it will ALWAYS have exactly 1 "default" name.
D - Default - This is the "preferred" name - by the USPS - for a city. Each ZIP Code has one - and only one - "default" name. In most cases, this is what people who live in that area call the city as well.
A - Acceptable - This name can be used for mailing purposes. Often times alternative names are large neighborhoods or sections of the city/town. In some cases a ZIP Code may have several "acceptable" names which is used to group towns under one ZIP Code.
N - Not Acceptable - A "not acceptable" name is, in many cases, a nickname that residents give that location. According to the USPS, you should NOT send mail to that ZIP Code using the "not acceptable" name when mailing.


CBSA Type

Metro (over 50,000 population)
Micro (10,000 - 50,000 population)


MSA = Metropolitan Statistical Area
MSAs are defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget only, and used by the U.S. Census Bureau and other U.S. government agencies for statistical purposes only

CBSA = Core Based Statistical Area
A Core Based Statistical Area is the official term for a functional region based around an urban center of at least 10,000 people, based on standards published by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in 2000. These standards are used to replace the definitions of metropolitan areas that were defined in 1990.  A CBSA is broken into two sub categories, Metro and Micro, and are detailed in the CBSA Type Field. These are defined by their population densities. To be considered a Micro area, population must be between 10,000 and 50,000. To be considered a Metro area, population must exceed 50,000.

DIV = Core Based Statistical Area Division number
A metropolitan statistical area containing an urbanized area of at least 2.5 million people can be subdivided into two or more "metropolitan divisions," provided specified criteria are met. Metropolitan divisions are conceptually similar the primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSAs) defined under previous standards.


ZCTA = Zip Code Tabulation Area
